I think I have installed ipopt successfully following this post:

For others with similar problem, I finally figured out. Basically need a fortran compiler (as @anthony-s said) and need to run the script provided by Udacity as a sudo user. So need to do both: sudo apt-get install gfortran sudo bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.7
The commands needed: 
sudo apt-get install gfortran
sudo bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.7

In my opinion, the issue is fixed by the following:
1. download the tgz package instead of zip

2. use the sudo command
3. install gfortran first
